## Repomix CLI Tool

- **Data Collection**: The Repomix CLI tool does **not** collect, transmit, or store any user data, telemetry, or repository information.
- **Network Usage**: Repomix CLI operates fully offline after installation. The only cases where an internet connection is needed are:
  - Installation via npm/yarn.
  - Using the `--remote` flag to process remote repositories.
  - Checking for updates (manually triggered).
- **Security Considerations**: Since all processing is local, Repomix CLI is safe to use with private and internal repositories.

## Repomix Website ([repomix.com](https://repomix.com/))

- **Data Collection**: The Repomix website uses **Google Analytics** to collect usage data, such as page views and user interactions. This helps us understand how the website is used and improve the user experience.
- **File Processing**: When uploading ZIP files or folders, your files are temporarily stored on our servers for processing. All uploaded files and processed data are automatically deleted immediately after processing is complete.

## Repomix Browser Extension

- **Data Collection**: The Repomix browser extension does **not** collect, transmit, or store any user data, telemetry, or repository information.
