## üîç Scope

This security policy applies to:

## üîí Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly to help us address the issue without putting the project or its users at risk.

### Reporting Methods

- **GitHub Security Advisory**:  
   You can securely report a vulnerability by [opening a security advisory on GitHub](https://github.com/yamadashy/repopack/security/advisories/new). This allows us to handle the issue privately and ensure it's fixed before any public disclosure.

- **Email**:  
   If you prefer, you can also report the vulnerability via email to `koukun0120@gmail.com`. Please include the following:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Any potential impact it might cause
   - Suggestions on how to mitigate or fix the vulnerability (if known)

### What Happens Next?

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days.
- **Investigation**: Our team will investigate the issue and, if necessary, ask for additional information.
- **Fixing**: Once the vulnerability is verified, we will prioritize a fix and release the necessary patches or updates.
- **Disclosure**: With your consent, we will credit you for the discovery in any public release notes or security advisory.

## üö® Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

To ensure a smooth process and maintain project security, we request that you:

- **Do not publicly disclose** the vulnerability until we have had the opportunity to investigate and resolve it.
- **Avoid any exploitation** beyond what is required to demonstrate the issue.
- **Provide clear details** about the vulnerability, such as a proof of concept or steps to reproduce the issue.

## üèÜ Acknowledgment and Recognition
