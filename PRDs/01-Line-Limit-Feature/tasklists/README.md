# Task Lists for Line Limit Feature

This directory contains detailed task breakdowns for each sprint of the line limit feature implementation.

## Available Task Lists

1. [Research and Design](./01-research-and-design.md) - Tasks for the initial research and design phase
2. [Core Implementation](./02-core-implementation.md) - Tasks for implementing the core functionality
3. [Testing and Refinement](./03-testing-and-refinement.md) - Tasks for comprehensive testing and final polish

## Usage

Each task list corresponds to a sprint in the [sub-sprints](../sub-sprints/) directory. Teams can work through these tasks sequentially, marking items as complete as they progress.

## Tracking Progress

- Use `[ ]` for pending tasks
- Use `[x]` for completed tasks
- Use `[-]` for tasks currently in progress

## Notes

- These task lists are living documents and may be updated as the project evolves
- Dependencies between tasks should be noted in the individual task descriptions
- blockers or issues should be documented and addressed before proceeding
