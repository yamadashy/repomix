This release brings enhanced MCP flexibility with output format options and significantly improved performance through worker system optimization!

## What's New 🚀

### MCP Output Format Support (#839)
Added the powerful `style` parameter to MCP tools, allowing users to choose their preferred output format for AI analysis workflows. Now supports XML, Markdown, JSON, and Plain text formats.

**Available Formats:**
- **XML**: Structured with `<file>` tags (default for backward compatibility)
- **Markdown**: Human-readable with `##` headers and code blocks
- **JSON**: Machine-readable with files as key-value pairs, making it easy to extract specific file contents programmatically
- **Plain**: Simple format with separators

## Improvements ⚡

### Worker System Performance Optimization (#851)
Significantly improved Repomix performance through comprehensive worker system refactoring:

- **1.5-2x faster processing speed** - Consolidating worker lifecycle management and improving concurrency handling
- **Reduced memory usage** - Wrapping the entire processing in child process to minimize main process memory footprint, especially beneficial when using Repomix as a library

This addresses the performance regression introduced in v1.2.1's memory optimizations while maintaining the memory improvements and providing better integration experience for library usage.

### MCP Parameter Handling Fix (#849, #854)
Fixed critical bug where the `read_repomix_output` tool wasn't handling string parameters correctly from certain MCP clients like Cursor AI. The tool now properly converts string parameters to numbers, ensuring line range reading works correctly across all clients.

### Git Log Token Count Display (#852)
Enhanced CLI summary reporting with token count display for git logs when using the `--include-logs` option, providing better visibility into included content size.

```
📊 Pack Summary:
────────────────
  Total Files: 740 files
 Total Tokens: 680,781 tokens
  Total Chars: 2,556,220 chars
       Output: repomix-output.xml
     Security: ✔ No suspicious files detected
     Git Logs: ✔ Git logs included (3,203 tokens)
```

This maintains consistency with the existing git diffs token count display and helps users understand the token impact of including git history.

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
