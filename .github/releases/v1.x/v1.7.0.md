This release introduces TypeScript/JavaScript config support and Azure DevOps integration, making Repomix more flexible and compatible with enterprise development environments!

## What's New 🚀

### TypeScript/JavaScript Config File Support (#870, #886)
Added support for TypeScript and JavaScript configuration files with a `defineConfig` helper function for better developer experience, similar to Vite and ESLint.

This provides a more flexible alternative to static JSON configurations, allowing you to implement any dynamic configuration you need.

```typescript
// repomix.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'repomix';

const today = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10);

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    filePath: `repomix-output-${today}.xml`,
    style: 'xml',
  },
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Full TypeScript type checking in config files
- Excellent IDE autocomplete and IntelliSense
- Dynamic configuration based on environment (timestamps, environment variables, etc.)

**Priority Order:**
1. **TypeScript** (`repomix.config.ts`, `repomix.config.mts`, `repomix.config.cts`)
2. **JavaScript/ES Module** (`repomix.config.js`, `repomix.config.mjs`, `repomix.config.cjs`)
3. **JSON** (`repomix.config.json5`, `repomix.config.jsonc`, `repomix.config.json`)

### Azure DevOps Remote Repository Support (#848, #881)
Added support for Azure DevOps remote repository URLs, making Repomix compatible with enterprise environments using Azure DevOps.

Azure DevOps uses special URL formats:
- SSH: `git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/org/project/repo`
- HTTPS: `https://dev.azure.com/organization/project/_git/repo`

Repomix now correctly parses and processes these URLs when packing remote repositories.

## Bug Fixes 🐛

### Binary Files Now Visible in Directory Structure (#841, #883)
Fixed a regression where binary files were not appearing in the directory structure section of the output, despite the documentation stating they should be included.

This regression was introduced in v0.1.18 (August 2024) when implementing the security check feature. Binary files are now correctly included in the directory structure while remaining properly excluded from the file contents section.

### Remote Repository Output Path Handling (#873, #885)
Fixed an error that occurred when using the remote repository feature with an absolute path specified for the output file. The tool now correctly handles cases where source and target paths resolve to the same location, preventing unnecessary file copy operations.

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
