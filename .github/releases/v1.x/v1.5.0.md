This release brings comprehensive JSON output format support with jq integration, making Repomix more efficient and versatile for AI analysis!

## What's New 🚀

### JSON Output Format Support (#837)
Added the powerful `--style json` option that generates structured, programmatically-friendly JSON output with hierarchical data structure and camelCase properties!

```bash
# Generate JSON output
repomix --style json

# Via configuration file
{
  "output": {
    "style": "json"
  }
}
```

The JSON format provides a clean structure:
```json5
{
  "fileSummary": { /* metadata and usage guidelines */ },
  "directoryStructure": "src/\n  cli/\n    ...",
  "files": {
    "src/index.js": "// File contents here"
  }
}
```

Perfect for programmatic processing with `jq`:
```bash
# Extract file list
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'

# Get specific file content
cat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files["src/index.js"]'
```

This JSON format is particularly easy to handle with `jq`, enabling AI agents to efficiently extract specific parts without processing the entire output.

## Improvements ⚡

### CLI Help Text Enhancement (#831)
Improved CLI help text clarity and accuracy with corrected default values and better descriptions, making it easier for AI agents to handle Repomix more accurately when assisting users.

## Bug Fixes 🐛

### MCP Server Error Response Fix (#834)
Fixed MCP server error responses by removing redundant `structuredContent` that was incorrectly returning schema non-compliant content during errors.

Special thanks to @huy-trn for spotting this issue and providing the fix!


## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
