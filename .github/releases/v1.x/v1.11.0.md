This release introduces the `--split-output` option for splitting large packed outputs into multiple files, making Repomix more practical for AI tools with file size limits!

## What's New 🚀

### Split Output for Large Codebases (#1013)

Added the `--split-output` option that automatically splits packed output into multiple numbered files when dealing with large codebases. This is particularly useful when working with AI tools that have file size limits (e.g., Google AI Studio's 1MB limit).

```bash
# Split output into files of max 1MB each
repomix --split-output 1mb

# Larger chunks for bigger context windows
repomix --split-output 20mb

# With decimal values
repomix --split-output 1.5mb
```

This generates numbered files like:
- `repomix-output.1.xml`
- `repomix-output.2.xml`
- `repomix-output.3.xml`

Size can be specified with units: `500kb`, `1mb`, `2mb`, `1.5mb`, etc. Decimal values are supported.

> [!NOTE]
> Files are grouped by top-level directory to maintain context. A single file or directory will never be split across multiple output files.

Special thanks to @Dango233 for this contribution! 🎉

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
