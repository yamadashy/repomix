This release improves binary file detection, encoding detection, and comment removal reliability, making Repomix more robust when processing diverse codebases!

## Bug Fixes 🐛

### Fixed Comment Removal Hanging Issue (#975, #1009)

Replaced `strip-comments` with `@repomix/strip-comments`, a fork with enhanced language support and bug fixes.

Resolves the hanging issue when processing large files with `removeComments: true`

### Fixed Encoding Detection Issues (#869, #1007)

Removed the jschardet confidence check that was incorrectly skipping valid files.

- **Fixes #869** - Valid Python files no longer skipped with low confidence scores
- **Fixes #847** - HTML files with Thymeleaf syntax (`~{`) no longer incorrectly detected as binary

## Improvements ⚡

### Enhanced Binary File Detection (#1006)

Replaced `istextorbinary` with actively maintained alternatives:
- `is-binary-path`: Extension-based detection (47M weekly downloads)
- `isbinaryfile`: Content-based detection with zero dependencies

This ~20x improvement in binary extension coverage reduces unnecessary content checks for common binary formats.

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
