This release introduces Claude Agent Skills generation support, enabling you to create AI-ready reference packages from any codebase with a single command!

## What's New 🚀

### Claude Agent Skills Generation (#952, #998)

Added a new `--skill-generate` option that creates structured [Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) packages for Claude Code. Skills are pre-packaged code references that help Claude understand and work with specific projects more effectively.

```bash
# Generate a skill from your codebase
repomix --skill-generate

# From remote repository with custom name
repomix --remote facebook/react --skill-generate react-reference

# Documentation-only skill
repomix --remote anthropics/claude-code-action --include "docs/**" --skill-generate
```

This is particularly useful for referencing implementations from open source projects—generate a skill from any repository, and Claude can reference those patterns while working on your code.

**Key Features:**

- **Interactive Location Selection**: Choose between Project Skills (`.claude/skills/`) for team sharing or Personal Skills (`~/.claude/skills/`) for individual use
- **Auto-naming**: Automatically generates skill names as `repomix-reference-<folder-name>`
- **Multi-file Output Structure**:
  - `SKILL.md` - Entry point with usage guide
  - `references/summary.md` - Purpose, format, and statistics
  - `references/project-structure.md` - Directory tree with line counts
  - `references/files.md` - All file contents
  - `references/tech-stack.md` - Languages, frameworks, and dependencies
- **Tech Stack Detection**: Automatically detects languages, frameworks, dependencies, runtime versions (`.node-version`, `.tool-versions`), and configuration files
- **MCP Tool Support**: New `generate_skill` MCP tool for programmatic skill generation

## Security 🔒

### npm Trusted Publishing Support (#974)

Repomix now uses npm's Trusted Publishing with OIDC authentication for package releases. This eliminates the need for long-lived npm tokens and adds provenance attestation to published packages.

**What this means for users:**
- Cryptographically verifiable proof that packages are built from this repository
- Enhanced supply chain security with `npm audit signatures` verification
- Protection against token leaks and unauthorized publishing

## Website Enhancements 🌐

### Privacy Policy Page (#981)

Added a dedicated [Privacy Policy page](https://repomix.com/guide/privacy) to the website, making privacy information more accessible. The page covers data handling for CLI, Website, Browser Extension, and includes a liability disclaimer.

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
