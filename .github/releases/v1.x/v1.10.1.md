This release improves skill generation for remote repositories, making the `--skill-generate --remote` workflow more reliable and informative!

## Bug Fixes 🐛

### Fixed Project Name Generation for Remote Repositories (#1001)

Previously, the project name was incorrectly derived from the temp directory name (e.g., "Repomix HPkbgH"). Now it correctly extracts the repository name from the URL.

```bash
repomix --remote https://github.com/vitejs/vite --skill-generate
# Before: SKILL.md title was "Reference codebase for Repomix HPkbgH"
# After: SKILL.md title is "Reference codebase for Vite" ✨
```

### Fixed `.claude/` Directory Conflicts (#1001)

When the remote repository has its own `.claude/` directory (with commands, agents, etc.), only `.claude/skills/` is now copied to prevent conflicts with your existing configuration.

## Improvements ⚡

### Source URL in SKILL.md (#1001)

For remote repositories, the SKILL.md footer now includes the source URL for easy reference:
- Remote: `This skill was generated by Repomix from https://github.com/vitejs/vite`
- Local: No URL included (to avoid exposing personal paths)

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
