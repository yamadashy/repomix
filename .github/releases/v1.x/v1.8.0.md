This release introduces official Claude Code plugins and enhanced directory visibility, making Repomix more powerful for AI-powered development workflows and project exploration!

## What's New 🚀

### Repomix Claude Code Plugins (#893)
Added official Repomix plugins for Claude Code, enabling seamless AI-powered codebase analysis directly within your Claude Code environment!

**Two complementary plugins:**
- **repomix-mcp**: MCP server integration providing tools for packing, searching, and reading codebases
- **repomix-commands**: Natural language slash commands (`/pack-local`, `/pack-remote`) for quick operations

Learn more in the [Claude Code Plugins documentation](https://repomix.com/guide/claude-code-plugins).

### Full Directory Structure Display (#896)
Added the `--include-full-directory-structure` option to display the complete repository directory tree when using `--include` patterns!

```bash
repomix --include "cli/**/*.go" --include-full-directory-structure
```

This shows the full project structure while maintaining focused file selection, providing better context for AI analysis.
