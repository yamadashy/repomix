This release fixes a critical bug with the `--stdin` option and includes dependency updates and website improvements.

## Bug Fixes 🐛

### Fixed `--stdin` Option Hang in v1.6.0 (#867, #878)
Resolved a critical issue where the `--stdin` option would hang when piping file paths to Repomix.

The problem occurred because v1.6.0 moved the entire CLI processing to child_process workers for better resource isolation, but child_process workers don't inherit stdin from the parent process by default. This caused commands like `git ls-files | repomix --stdin` to hang indefinitely.

**The fix:** Stdin processing now happens in the main process before passing file paths to the worker.

This ensures that stdin-based workflows work correctly while preserving the stability improvements introduced in v1.6.0.

## Improvements ⚡

### Website Enhancements (#864, #865)
- Added cancel functionality for pack requests, allowing users to stop long-running operations

### CI/CD Improvements (#866)
- Replaced ratchet with pinact for GitHub Actions SHA pinning

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
