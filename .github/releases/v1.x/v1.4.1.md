This maintenance release focuses on improving the `--remote` option reliability.

## Improvements ⚡

### Remote Repository Processing (#777, #806)
The `--remote` option now automatically detects the default branch instead of assuming `main`:

- Works with repositories using `main`, `master`, or custom default branches
- No longer fails on repositories with non-standard default branch names

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
