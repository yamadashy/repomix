This release brings significant performance improvements across the board—faster startup, optimized file collection, and reduced package size—along with a smoother CLI experience for remote repositories!

## What's New 🚀

### Auto-detect Remote URLs Without `--remote` Flag (#1145)

You can now pass GitHub URLs directly as positional arguments without the `--remote` flag:

```bash
# Before
repomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo

# Now also works!
repomix https://github.com/user/repo
```

The CLI automatically detects explicit remote URLs (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) in positional arguments and treats them as remote repository targets.

## Improvements ⚡

### Node.js Module Compile Cache for Faster Startup (#1181)

Enabled Node.js V8 compile cache (available in Node.js 22.8.0+) for approximately **10% faster startup time**. The compiled module cache is stored automatically and speeds up subsequent launches.

### Optimized File Collection with UTF-8 Fast Path (#1155)

Improved file collection performance with two key optimizations:
- **UTF-8 fast path**: Skips expensive encoding detection for files that are valid UTF-8, which covers the vast majority of source code files
- **Promise pool**: Replaced worker threads with a lightweight promise pool for better concurrency control

### Streaming tar.gz Extraction for Remote Repositories (#1153)

Replaced ZIP archive download with **streaming tar.gz extraction** for remote repository operations:
- Better handling of large repositories

### Smaller npm Package (#1092)

Removed unused source maps from the npm package, reducing `lib/` size from **2.4MB to 1.2MB** (~50% reduction).

## Bug Fixes 🐛

### Skip Retry on Archive Extraction Error (#1149)

Fixed an issue where archive extraction errors would trigger unnecessary retries. Extraction errors are now treated as non-retryable, providing faster error feedback.

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
