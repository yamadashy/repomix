This release fixes critical Go code processing issues and improves binary file reporting for better user experience!

## Bug Fixes 🐛

### Fix Go Code `--remove-comments` Processing (#814)
Fixed a critical hang issue when processing Go files containing backtick raw string literals in function calls. This specific pattern in Go syntax wasn't being handled correctly by our comment removal logic, causing infinite loops.

This made Repomix completely unusable for a few Go projects, as the process would hang indefinitely.

**Problematic pattern that caused hangs:**
```go
func example() {
    fmt.Fprintln(out, heredoc.Doc(`
        Multi-line raw string content
    `))
}
```

### Binary File Detection Reporting (#815)
Fixed confusing relative path display in binary file detection reports. Now shows clear full paths to make it easier to identify excluded files.

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
