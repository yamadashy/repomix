This release fixes an issue with output file extensions introduced in v1.9.0 and reduces package size, making Repomix more intuitive and efficient!

## Bug Fixes 🐛

### Fixed Output File Extension Not Matching Style (#947)

Fixed an issue where the output file extension didn't automatically match the selected style. Now when you use `--style markdown`, `--style json`, or `--style plain`, the output filename will automatically use the corresponding extension (`.md`, `.json`, or `.txt`).

**Before (v1.9.0):**
```bash
repomix --style markdown
# Output: repomix-output.xml (wrong extension!)
```

**After (v1.9.1):**
```bash
repomix --style markdown
# Output: repomix-output.md ✨
```

This behavior applies when the output filename is not explicitly specified via `--output` or in the config file.

Special thanks to @Ahmad8864 for their first contribution fixing this issue! 🎉

We also appreciate @pranc1ngpegasus for their alternative implementation in #949 and detailed investigation of this issue!

## Improvements ⚡

### Reduced Package Size (#942)

Replaced `tree-sitter-wasms` with `@repomix/tree-sitter-wasms`, which contains only the language parsers needed for Repomix. This reduces the total package size by approximately **25%**, resulting in faster installation times and lower disk usage.

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
