This release introduces the Repomix Explorer plugin for advanced AI-powered codebase analysis and .ignore file support, making Repomix more flexible and powerful for development workflows!

## What's New 🚀

### `.ignore` File Support (#937, #938)
Added support for `.ignore` files, which are used by tools like ripgrep and the silver searcher! This allows you to maintain a single `.ignore` file that works across multiple tools.

```bash
# Enable .ignore file support (enabled by default)
repomix

# Disable .ignore file support
repomix --no-dot-ignore

# Configure in repomix.config.json
{
  "ignore": {
    "useDotIgnore": false
  }
}
```

**Ignore file priority order:**
1. Custom patterns
2. `.repomixignore`
3. **`.ignore`** (new!)
4. `.gitignore`
5. Default patterns

This feature is especially useful for users of ripgrep, ag, fd, and other modern search tools, enabling consistent ignore patterns across your entire toolchain.

### Repomix Explorer Plugin (#908)
Added the **repomix-explorer** Claude Code plugin that enables intelligent, AI-powered exploration and analysis of codebases using natural language!

**Installation:**
```bash
/plugin marketplace add yamadashy/repomix
/plugin install repomix-explorer@repomix
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Analyze local codebases
/repomix-explorer:explore-local <path-to-repo>

# Analyze remote GitHub repositories
/repomix-explorer:explore-remote <repo-url>
```

The agent executes `npx repomix@latest` to pack the repository, then uses intelligent search strategies to provide comprehensive analysis without overwhelming context limits.
