This release improves `.gitignore` handling to better match Git's standard behavior and includes GitHub Actions fixes!

## Improvements ⚡

### Improved .gitignore Handling (#964)

Updated to globby v16 and enhanced `.gitignore` handling to match Git's standard behavior. Parent directory `.gitignore` files are now properly respected, making file filtering more intuitive and consistent with how Git itself operates.

**Key improvements:**
- ✅ Parent directory `.gitignore` files are now properly respected
- ✅ Consistent behavior with Git's standard ignore pattern matching

## Bug Fixes 🐛

### Fixed GitHub Actions `compress` Option (#965)

Fixed a bug where setting `compress: false` in GitHub Actions incorrectly added an unsupported `--no-compress` argument. The logic is now corrected so that `--compress` is only added when explicitly enabled.

Special thanks to @chinchala for their first contribution! 🎉

## How to Update

```bash
npm update -g repomix
```
